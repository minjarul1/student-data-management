       return_date DATE,                          -- Date the book is to be returned
       status ENUM('Borrowed', 'Available') DEFAULT 'Available', -- Status of the book
       FOREIGN KEY (borrowed_by) REFERENCES students(student_id) -- Relates to students table
   );

   -- Create results table
   CREATE TABLE results (
       result_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,  -- Unique ID for each result record
       student_id INT,                            -- Relates to the student
       subject VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,             -- Subject name
       marks INT,                                 -- Marks obtained

       FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id) -- Relates to students table
   );
   ```

3. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
    gh repo clone minjarul1/student-data-management
   ```

4. **Update Database Configuration**:
   - Edit the `config.php` file to match your local server settings:
     ```php
     <?php
     $servername = "localhost";
     $username = "root";
     $password = "";
     $dbname = "school_management";
     ?>
     ```

5. **Import Existing Data (Optional)**:
   - If a `schema.sql` or sample data file is provided, import it to initialize the database.


## Running Tests

To ensure that the application functions as expected, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - Install and configure XAMPP or WAMP.
   - Clone the repository and place it in the `htdocs` folder (for XAMPP) or `www` folder (for WAMP).

     ```bash
     gh repo clone minjarul1/student-data-management
     ```

2. **Database Setup**:
   - Start the MySQL service in XAMPP/WAMP.
   - Access `phpMyAdmin` by navigating to:
     ```
     http://localhost/phpmyadmin
     ```
   - Create a new database named `school_management`.
   - Import the SQL file (`schema.sql`) included in the project to set up tables.

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Start the Apache service in XAMPP/WAMP.
   - Open a browser and visit:
     ```
     http://localhost/student-library-result-system
     ```

4. **Test Functionalities**:
   - **Student Form**: Add, edit, and delete student records.
   - **Library Form**: Add books, update their borrowing status, and view details.
   - **Results Form**: Record exam results and update them as needed.
   - Check for data consistency in the MySQL database after performing each action.

5. **Validate Features**:
   - Ensure that all forms validate input data correctly.
   - Test different edge cases, such as duplicate email entries for students or invalid book statuses.

6. **Check Responsiveness**:
   - Test the application on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure proper functionality and design.
